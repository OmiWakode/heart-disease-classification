# heart-disease-classification
ML model to predict heart disease.
This Jupyter Notebook contains a series of machine learning models to predict wether a person has heart disease or not based on their medical attributes.

The data set was downloaded from [Heart Disease Uci Data Set Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/)

This project was made following [Complete Data Science and Machine Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/).

Here is the roc curve for the best fitted model.
